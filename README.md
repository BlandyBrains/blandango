# Blandango 
An *incomplete* Rust driver for ArangoDB. This is a side project I started while working with ArangoDB.

### Coverage
- [x] Database
- [x] Collection
- [x] Document
- [x] Indices
- [x] Simple Query / Cursor
- [ ] Views and Search
- [ ] Analyzers
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Foxx MircoServices
- [ ] Transactions
- [ ] Schema Validation
- [ ] Tasks

Completeness is not guaranteed, nor is it a goal of this project. Features are implemented as needed to support external system objectives.

I would suggest the [python-arango](https://docs.python-arango.com/en/main/index.html) driver for a more complete and mature feature set.
